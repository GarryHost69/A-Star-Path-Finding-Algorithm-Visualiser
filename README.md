# A-Star-Path-Finding-Algorithm-Visualiser

A* Algorithm is a path finding Algorithm which can be used to find the shortest path 
between any starting node and goal node. A* can find the path more efficiently than
Dijkstra's Algorithm by making use of heuristic function.

You can either use the Eucledian distance as a heuristic or use the Manhattan distance
by uncommenting the part in the heuristic function.

You Can Increase or Decrease the size of the grid, Add obstacles randomly or create
your own obstacles by pressing the left mouse button on the cell that you'd like to
make as an obstacle.

This algorithm is made using arrays, It can be made even more efficient by making 
the use of a more suitable data structure like a tree to keep track of the neighbours.

Diagonal movement is not Added in this code. It's easy to add but I just don't like 
the diagonal movement, the path does not look that good with diagonal movement as it
does without it, of course that is not very practical however.
